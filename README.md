This project will make an API call to https://www.exchangerate-api.com/ utilizing an API key to acquire the current exchange rates. The project will then use jQuery and JavaScript functions to pull the value from the user interface and return the value in the requested currency. Various npm and webpack tools will bundle and process the code into a more "machine friendly" format.
